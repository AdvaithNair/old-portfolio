                <p>
                Aglet is a Full Stack Web Application that tracks your sneaker collection, including shoes you own and shoes you're about to cop!
                <br><br>
                This CRUD application allows you to create sneaker listings, update parameters, and delete them as you desire. 
                Parameters include Ranking, Name, Price, Colorway, and Ownership.
                Furthermore, it uses NodeJS and ExpressJS to connect with a MongoDB backend, where I used GraphQL to interact with said database. 
                Then to link it to the frontend, I used Apollo and Mongoose to run functions to compelte the app.
                <br><br>
                This project took me about two weeks to complete. I may consider hosting the database on the cloud, but that's an upgrade for later.

                <h3>FIRST Tech Challenge SKYSTONE Scoring Web App</h3>
                <h4 id = "skill">HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h4>
                <p>
                SKYSTONE Scoring is a simple Frontend Web Application I created to calculate score for the 2019-2020 FIRST Tech Challenge SKYSTONE Game. 
                <br><br>
                It includes a simple UI to enter variables for the game and a calculator JavaScript file where everything is calculated.
                The UI was advanced in the sense that it was automated to the extent where a user can't input a score that's impossible.
                For example, there's no way to get over 6 stones in autonomous, and there's no way to deliver more stones than the amount placed.
                This allows for the most accurate score, a feature that was unique to my web app compared to the multiple apps out in the marketplace.
                <br><br>
                This project took me a week to create, but I gradually made updates over the month.
                Unfortunately due to COVID-19, all further FIRST Tech Challenge competitions were cancelled, therefore I stopped updating the app.

                <p>
                The Mocking GUI and the Mocking Discord Bot are two seperate projects that I grouped together because they use the same "mocking algorithm" to work. 
                It also has a website version that you could check out below.
                <br><br>
                The Mocking GUI uses a randomization algorithm that capitalizes random letters, with the exception of I (always lowercase "i") and L (always uppercase "L").
                I decided to make a quick Tkinter app that would generate the randomized output based on a sentence/paragraph input at the top. 
                I was honestly bored and made this because I use it in my normal Discord groupchats. 
                Shoutout to Kinda Sketch for giving me a reason to make this :)
                <br><br>
                The MockBot (Mocking Discord Bot) was another expression of my free time, where I made a Discord bot with many features using Discord.py, mostly to do with the mocking function.
                It had a mock mode, where when I start it, the bot just repeats back everything I say, and it's something I can stop.
                Furthemore, it had preset features such as "/kanye", where it spits out a mocked version of his famous song, "Lift Yourself".
                The reason why I made the Discord bot was to have someone to talk to at 2 AM when all my friends were asleep. Oops.
                <br><br>
                This project took me the best part of one week to complete all three tasks (Tkinter App, Discord Bot, Website).
                It was just a fun little project I made, and actually ended up using in my many day-to-day social interactions.
                Sorry to all my friends who recieved mocked messages for two weeks, now you know why I did that :)

                <p>
                Optic is a Visual Finance Desktop Application designed to help you track your expenses.
                <br><br>
                This one is still a work in progress, as I'm still designing the backend structure, but I'm thinking of using SQL and Apache or NodeJS.
                For the meantime, I made an ElectronJS app that compiles to an executable file.
                The point of this app is to have a visual indicator of your personal expenses based on the way you input them.
                I created this app to replace my Excel document that I've been using to track my expenses since I arrived at college.
                However due to COVID-19, I don't really track my expenses anymore, as I don't spend much anymore.
                I plan to fix up this app and finish it with a proper backend eventually, but this will happen after I reintroduce myself to SQL backend.
                <br><br>
                Optic took me three weeks to start up, but I eventually had to set aside the project due to excessive school work. 
                I intend on revisiting Optic, but for the meantime, feel to take a look at the current web code for Optic I have set up below.

                <br><br>
                This is actually the first project I made going into college. 
                I wanted to pick up some skills regarding Flutter, and decided that making an app like this is the best way to do so.
                This is a simple app using Dart and some functions to make sure everything saves in a List format.
                It uses the default Material UI offered by Google, which actually inspired me to make designs like I do on this website.
                <br><br>
                MemorEase took me three weeks to complete, as I comprehensively followed a tutorial and adapted it to fir the product idea I had.
                Although this isn't my most impressive app, it led way to create some of my better apps you see towards the top of this section.
